You can create multiple rewards from one discount. Rewards that are issued are single-use, meaning that you can give the customer the same reward twice and they'll have two chances to use the reward. Rewards come with a name, which will be displayed to the customer, and expiration for how the customer has to use the reward. If you provide a description of the discount the reward is made from, that description will be displayed and the same for all rewards from the discount. Each customer has their own reward list, when you issue a reward they'll be able to see the reward in their reward list and also receive a push notification alerting them of the new reward, if they agree to push notification.
