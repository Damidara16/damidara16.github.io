If you're familiar with accepting orders and running parts of your restaurant on an online store, you'll find that having an app is a better, more convenient, and more effective way of digital ordering. Having an OAL allows you to always be a touch away for customers, along with a growing list of features that can really take your restaurant to another level. Also with an OAL app you can ditch costly and ineffective email marketing and no cost use push notifications."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"OAL is perfect for multiple locations, so your customers can order anywhere and keep their data in one place. To get an OAL, you'll need a Square and Craspa account. From there you'll be able to create your own app in less than 7 minutes. There's no need to design or worry about the inner details of the app, we know not everyone is a designer, but would still want a modern and stylish app for your brand. Simply choose a template, onboarding screen, and icons and your set, we'll take it from there and create your app and send you a private version. The reason we use templates is because we want every restaurant to have access to OAL and realized that most restaurants have the same needs. So there isn't a need to recreate a whole new app for every restaurant and doing it cost effectively. This also allows us to offer OAL for free. The way we make your app unique to your brand is by branding your logos and using a generated color scheme for the OAL that matches your brand's color.
