The discount object comes with the required items and discounted items feature. For example, say you want to buy 2 apples and get the 3rd free. First, you create a discount for 100% off, then. you create 2 required items for the apples and 1 discounted item for the apples. The 2 required items will be priced at full price and the 1 discounted will have the discount applied. The way the order flow is controlled is that your customer will be directed to add the 2 apples and then the last apple in one workflow. if the workflow is cancelled, all items added during the process will be removed. This allows you to control the order flow of customers.\nYou can also extend this functionally to not use discounted items and no discount will be applied. For example, you have a special "Try our new burger and fries", you\'ll create a discount with any discount and create 2 two required items for the burger and fries and the discount will be ignored since there are no discounted items provided.
